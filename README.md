# PokerOwlies
PokerOwlies is a simple C++ statistics for the Poker Texas Holde'm game when a RoyalFlush appears on the table.

Please, I know that the code style of this project could be improved (a lot). It is presented only for fun-purposes and part of the code does not reflect how I wrote the code professionally.
